# Changelog - 260221

## 260221-21:48:18 - Default to all-panes mode for full tmux visibility

### Summary
Visualiser now renders every pane by default so Lisa output is visible even when it is not the active pane.

### Added
- Added `--all-panes` runtime flag (default `true`) to control pane expansion behavior.
- Added pane-qualified identity keys to prevent per-pane tile collisions.
- Added tests covering pane-qualified keys and all-pane expansion.

### Changed
- Changed session discovery to expand each session into pane-level refs when all-panes mode is enabled.
- Changed refresh/capture path to use pane IDs from refs, avoiding active-pane-only blind spots.
- Changed status line to show pane-oriented counts and all-panes mode state.
- Changed README usage and behavior docs to reflect default all-panes capture.

### Fixed
- Fixed missing Lisa output in multi-pane sessions where the active pane was not the agent pane.

### Files
- `README.md`
- `src/main.go`
- `src/socket_test.go`
- `src/sockets.go`
- `src/state.go`
- `src/types.go`
- `src/ui.go`

### QA Notes
- Verify a multi-pane tmux session shows one tile per pane by default.
- Verify `--all-panes=false` returns to active-pane-only behavior.
- Verify Enter attach/select-key actions still target the focused pane tile.
- Verify status line reports `panes:<n>` when all-panes mode is on.
